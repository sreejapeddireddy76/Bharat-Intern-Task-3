**TASK:3 Number Recoginition:**

In this notebook, we are going to use the MNIST dataset for the implementation of a handwritten digit recognition app. To implement this we will use a special type of deep neural network called Convolutional Neural Networks. In the end, we will also build a Graphical user interface(GUI) where you can directly draw the digit and recognize it straight away.
